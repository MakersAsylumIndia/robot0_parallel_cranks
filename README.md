a simple walking mecha with a pair of legs driven by parallel crank mechanism.

- there are two versions - 3D printed and laser cut.
- Both require a set of four cranks that are 3D printed (/STL folder)
- 3D printed version uses 3D printed legs. 3mm printer filament is used to join the legs to the feet (see /images).
- In the laser cut version, feet are attached to legs using 3mm hardware.
- You will need small, 2mm self threading screws to assemble the robot. (such as the ones used to attach horns to servos).
